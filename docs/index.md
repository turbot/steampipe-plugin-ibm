# IBM Cloud + Steampipe

[IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud) is a set of cloud computing services for business including IaaS and PaaS.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

List VPCs in your IBM Cloud account:

```sql
select
  id,
  name,
  status,
  region
from
  ibm_is_vpc;
```

```
+-------------------------------------------+------+-----------+----------+
| id                                        | name | status    | region   |
+-------------------------------------------+------+-----------+----------+
| r006-db18c7a8-0ccd-43eb-b9c1-4216c9206201 | prod | available | us-east  |

## Get started

### Install

Download and install the latest IBM Cloud plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install ibm
```

### Credentials

| Item | Description |
| - | - |
| Credentials | [Create an API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui#manage-user-keys) from [IBM Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys). |
| Permissions | <ol><li>`Viewer` access for `All Account Management Services`</li><li>`Viewer` access for `All Identity and Access enabled services`</li></ol>|
| Radius | Each connection represents a single IBM cloud account. |
| Resolution | 1. `api_key` in steampipe config.<br />2. `IC_API_KEY` environment variable.<br />3. `IBMCLOUD_API_KEY` environment variable. |
| Region Resolution | 1. Regions set for the connection via the regions argument in the config file (~/.steampipe/config/ibm.spc).<br />2. The region specified in the `IC_REGION` or `IBMCLOUD_REGION` environment variable.|

### Configuration

Installing the latest ibm plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/ibm.spc`) with a single connection named `ibm`:

```hcl
connection "ibm" {
  plugin  = "ibm"

  # You may connect to one or more regions. If `regions` is not specified, 
  # Steampipe will use a single default region using:
  # The `IC_REGION` or `IBMCLOUD_REGION` environment variable
  # regions     = ["us-south", "eu-de"]
  
  # API Key from IBM Cloud
  # api_key = "0hrqaLNt-Nc831AW5k7z10CcwOGk_ttqTpOSWYJ2rnwi"
}
```

- Community: [Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/steampipe/shared_invite/zt-oij778tv-lYyRTWOTMQYBVAbtPSWs3g)

## Multi-Region Connections

You may also specify one or more regions with the `regions` argument:

```hcl
connection "ibm" {
  plugin  = "ibm"    
  regions = ["au-syd", "eu-de", "eu-gb", "jp-osa", "jp-tok", "us-east", "us-south"]
}
```

The `region` argument supports wildcards:

- All regions

  ```hcl
  connection "ibm" {
    plugin  = "ibm"    
    regions = ["*"] 
  }
  ```

- All US and EU regions

  ```hcl
  connection "ibm" {
    plugin    = "ibm"    
    regions   = ["us-*", "eu-*"] 
  }
  ```

IBM multi-region connections are common, but be aware that performance may be impacted by the number of regions and the latency to them.

## Configuring IBM Credentials

### Credentials from Environment Variables

The IBM plugin will use the standard IBM environment variables to obtain credentials **only if other arguments (`api_key`, `regions`) are not specified** in the connection:

```sh
export IC_API_KEY=0hrqaLNt-Nc831AW5k7z10CcwOGk_ttqTpOSWYJ2rnwi
export IBMCLOUD_API_KEY=0hrqaLNt-Nc831AW5k7z10CcwOGk_ttqTpOSWYJ2rnwi
```

```hcl
connection "ibm" {
  plugin = "ibm" 
}
```
